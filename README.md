# OXFORD-DICTIONARY
+ DEMO: Before running jar file, create a html file in src/main/resources/file  
with a name that you come up with. For simplicity, we will make a lion.html. 
I just love lion Inside it we write hello world. After that if we search for 
lion in the jar file we will see "hello wolrd". 
+ WHOLE PROJECT: Run the DictionaryManagement.java, it will generate all the
HTML file needed.
